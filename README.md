# Instance Segmentation for Campus Waste Detection Using Mask R-CNN

This project focuses on **detecting and segmenting campus waste** such as plastic bottles, metal cans, food containers, and paper using a **Mask R-CNN model**.  
The goal is to support sustainability efforts by automating waste identification and enabling smarter waste management practices.

### Key Features
- 🗑️ Instance segmentation of 4 waste categories: plastic bottles, metal cans, food containers, and paper  
- 🧠 Built on Detectron2 with a COCO-pretrained Mask R-CNN backbone  
- 📂 Custom dataset with annotated waste images from the University of New Haven campus  
- 📊 Includes dataset preparation, training, evaluation, and visualization scripts  
- 🚀 Supports transfer learning for domain adaptation  

### Use Cases
- ♻️ Campus waste monitoring and sustainability research  
- 🏫 Smart campus & IoT-based waste management systems  
- 🌍 Environmental impact studies and policy making  
- 🤖 Training AI models for recycling robots
